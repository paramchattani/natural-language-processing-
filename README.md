This is project on SENTIMENT ANALYSIS that analyse positive or a negative sentiments . We give two files pos.txt and neg.txt as input and using nltk we create our lexicon that becomes are featureset and pos and neg becomes are two classifiers or labels and are given as [1,0] and [0,1] . Then we break our data into train and test data and test data is 10 % of data(which eventually are two files pos and negative) and then with the help of neural network we feed it data into it and test aur accuracy. We alter weights 10 time to reduce the losses 

ACCURACY AS OBTAINED : 58.81801 %
